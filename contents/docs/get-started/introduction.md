<h2>
An educated pick of libraries, integrations, opinions and boilerplate to build modular and evolvable business web applications.
</h2>

At its core are **React**, a JavaScript UI library developed by Facebook, and **ASP .NET CORE**, a cross-platform backend web framework developed by Microsoft. Additionally this project gives an educated pick of additional **libraries**, **tooling** and **boilerplate** to ease the development of business applications. The library picks and boilerplate provide a very good starting point to write business applications productively by beeing opinionated. However the project setup is just boilerplate and due to its modularity you can remove or replace any library and bring in your own.

In that sense the glue project tries to give a highly productive setup while not sacrificing freedom (also that makes the setup adaptable to new emerging libraries).

## Philosophy

**TODO:** Libs xy are great. They are decoupled for a good reason. Glue provides a solid pick of libraries + integrations. Leverage open source, balance freedom/flexibiltiy and opininionated approach to provide productivity.

## Main Picks

- UI Controls (Ant Design)
- Navigation and Layouts (Ant Design + Reach Router)
- Forms (Formik + Ant Design + server side Asp Net Core validation)
- CQRS (Odata for reads + MediatR for commands)
- Datagrid (dx-grid + Odata)

## Probably upcoming Features

- Ready-to-use Business Modules (i.e. Audit-Log, Workflow etc...)
- Security (Asp .Net Core + IdentityServer)
- Datafetching (Suspense)
- Live/Bidirectional communication (SignalR)
- Hot Module Replacement (HRM) for React

## Evaluating

- Workflow Core
- GraphQL

## Extended

- Documentation (Gatsby + Antd)
- CI/CD (AzureDevops)
